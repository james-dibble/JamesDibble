Everyone has to have something named after themselves right...?

Here we have my (work in progress) application framework, collection of extension methods and service bus implementation.

* * *

##Application Framework
This is my collection of classes that I use to abstract certain operations out of actual projects I complete for other people.  After completing a couple of websites for clients, it was obvious what code could be extracted and shared between projects, so thats exactly what I did.

The idea is to create a consistant interface for accessing things like persitence and configuration.

Documentation for this will eventally appear on my [blog/portfolio website](http://www.jdibble.co.uk).

##Extensions
Speaks for itself, butt loads of extension methods!  I think every solo .Net programmer has at some point said "I'm gonna create a library to share all these extension methods one day...".  Well I actually did.  This is the proof.  So there.

##Service Bus
This namespace could be part of the Application Framework, but I felt it deserved it's own place in the solution.

##Legal Shizzle
For now, take what you want.  Use where you want.  Simples.
