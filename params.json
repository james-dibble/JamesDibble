After completing a couple of websites for clients, it was obvious what code could be extracted and shared between projects, so thats exactly what I did.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to create a consistant interface for accessing things like persitence and configuration.\r\n\r\nDocumentation for this will eventally appear on here.\r\n\r\n##Extensions\r\nSpeaks for itself, butt loads of extension methods!  I think every solo .Net programmer has at some point said \"I'm gonna create a library to share all these extension methods one day...\".  Well I actually did.  This is the proof.  So there.\r\n\r\n##Service Bus\r\nThis namespace could be part of the Application Framework, but I felt it deserved it's own place in the solution.\r\n\r\nDocumentation for this will eventally appear on my here.\r\n\r\n##Legal Shizzle\r\nFor now, take what you want.  Use where you want.  Simples.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
