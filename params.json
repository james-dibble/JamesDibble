{"name":"James Dibble","tagline":"","body":"#JamesDibble\r\nEveryone has to have something named after themselves right...?\r\n\r\nHere we have my (work in progress) application framework, collection of extension methods and service bus implementation.\r\n\r\nThe solution is continuously integrated using [AppHarbour](https://appharbor.com/).\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n##Application Framework\r\nThis is my collection of classes that I use to abstract certain operations out of actual projects I complete for other people.  After completing a couple of websites for clients, it was obvious what code could be extracted and shared between projects, so that's exactly what I did.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to create a consistent interface for accessing things like persitence and configuration.\r\n\r\nI'm working on creating some documentation.\r\n\r\n##Extensions\r\nSpeaks for itself, butt loads of extension methods!  I think every solo .Net programmer has at some point said \"I'm gonna create a library to share all these extension methods one day...\".  Well I actually did.  This is the proof.  So there.\r\n\r\n##Service Bus\r\nThis namespace could be part of the Application Framework, but I felt it deserved it's own place in the solution.  \r\n\r\n###What is it?\r\nThis is a work in progress enterprise service bus reusable class library for use in all types of applications no matter how big or small.\r\n\r\n###Where can I find out information on it.\r\nAgain, I am working on documentation for this, as well as a good way of sharing the design.\r\n\r\n##Legal Shizzle\r\nFor now, take what you want.  Use where you want.  Simples.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
